model <- lm(DancersRecruited ~ OnlineMarketing + DirectMarketing , data = your_data)
summary(model)

in this i would get a bunch of data on number of dancer we could recruit if 

-so with us we need to see if an econemetric study is sufficent for something like  ag hiring drive they might not need 
- but if they wanted to retain that might be useful 
- https://chat.openai.com/share/1fd6b527-b253-4bec-ae21-259a953ed391 this link has my lesson on how to make the regression for teh strip club 


-im thinkning maybe a small webisode or podcast with the existing danxers or podcast


        -so when we get a problem like this : We are trying to hire more dancers and waiters ?
         we break down the varibles 

                -how
                dancers = intercept + online marketing + direct marketing

            
           


                -okay we can shoot adds make a website to help women get they permit and make like a only fans type app 
                -also add clublink in there to boost revenue. 

                if iWas charging I want $100 for shooting the video and making the content and the website
                -they got to pay for there own hosting and domain name and server


                -so when i get my site together ima make they site and put the repport and make the nft mininting part too and then put on my site
