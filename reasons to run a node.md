reasons to run a node 
Why would you want to run a node? Here are some of the most common reasons:

You do not want to rely on any third party to validate the transactions you receive.

You do not want to disclose to third parties which transactions belong to your wallet.

You are developing Bitcoin software and need to rely on a Bitcoin node for programmable (API) access to the network and blockchain.

You are building applications that must validate transactions according to Bitcoin’s consensus rules. Typically, Bitcoin software companies run several nodes.

You want to support Bitcoin. Running a node that you use to validate the transactions you receive to your wallet makes the network more robust.
