forumulate hypothesis
identify Data sources
explore and preprocess the data?
choose the model like diffrence in diffence,propensity score matching, instrucmental varible analysis
estimate the model 
evaluate the goodness of fit by looking at r2 to see how close it is to observeed value
do hypthesis test to test significance of coeeficents this lets you know if you cN REject null hypthesis
verify models 4 assumtions:linearity,normality of errors,independence of errors,homoskedacity
Interpret the coefficents and the overall practaicallity in the model

13. Present and Communicate Results: -Prepare a clear and concise presentation of your findings. Clearly communicate the   
                                      methodology, results, and implications for the dog grooming business.
                                    
                                    14. Draw Conclusions:
Based on your analysis, draw conclusions about the causal relationship between the 10-year interest rate and the revenue of the dog grooming business. Discuss limitations and potential areas for future research.
