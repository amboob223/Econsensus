     Econometric Analysis of the Impact of Policy Change on Revenue from Cake Sales in Jails
Executive Summary:
This econometric analysis aimed to investigate the impact of a policy change allowing the selling of cakes among inmates on the revenue from cake sales in jails. The study utilized a linear regression model to explore the relationship between revenue and the binary variable representing the policy change. Findings suggest that the policy_change variable is not statistically significant in predicting revenue.


1. Introduction:
The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of a policy change on revenue generated from cake sales in jails. The dataset comprises observations on revenue and a binary variable indicating whether the policy change was in effect.

2. Data Description:
The dataset includes information on revenue from cake sales and the policy_change variable, representing whether the policy allowing cake sales among inmates was in place.

3. Model Specification:
The linear regression model used is:
\text{Revenue} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{policy_change} + u

4. Regression Results:
The regression results are as follows:



Coefficients:
              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)  
(Intercept)      90.00      18.26   4.930    0.016 *
policy_change    30.00      23.57   1.273    0.293  
The policy_change variable is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.293), indicating a lack of evidence to suggest a significant impact on revenue.

5. Residual Analysis:
The residuals show variations between predicted and actual revenue, with some observations exhibiting larger differences.

6. R-squared and Model Fit:
Multiple R-squared: 0.3506, Adjusted R-squared: 0.1342

The model explains approximately 13.42% of the variability in revenue, suggesting a limited fit.

7. Scatter Plot and Regression Line:
A scatter plot with a regression line was created to visualize the relationship between policy_change and revenue. The plot did not show a clear pattern.

8. Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that the policy_change variable is not statistically significant in predicting revenue from cake sales in jails. The model's fit is limited, suggesting that other factors may contribute to revenue variations.

9. Recommendations:
Further research and data collection are recommended to explore additional factors that may influence revenue in the context of cake sales in jails.
